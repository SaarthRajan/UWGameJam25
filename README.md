## About

You've arrived on residence for your first day of university to find the residence locked down due to a terrible murder.  All the more time to bond with your attractive, eligible suspects new dormmates!

Waterloo is Not Love Island is a game about genre confusion. Turns out, the structure of a dating sim is actually quite similar to another kind of game, and it looks like Waterloo isn't Love Island...
