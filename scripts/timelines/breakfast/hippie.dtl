hippie: Yo! The bugs say hello, now it is breakfast time! The bugs just finished their breakfast, they start to eat my clothes if I don’t feed them.
- I say hi back! Your bugs are cute, like you ;)
	hippie: I’ll pass the message along later, or you can come see them if you’d like!
- Woah they eat your clothes?
	hippie: Only if I don’t feed them… hasn’t happened in a while. My clothes take a bit to make so I don’t want them eating it. They’ll eat anything! But don’t worry, get on their good side and they won’t bite you.
hippie: My bugs like most people, sometimes [Music nerds]’s music bothers them, but not the person. They don’t seem found of Valter though, there’s probably a reason for that. He is pretty suspicious.
