musicNerd: Hey! How was your night? I hope there wasn’t too much noise keeping you up. … My speaker is being funny…
- Yeah I slept fine! Whats up with your speaker?
	musicNerd: It's dented. I uh dropped it a bit ago.
- I heard some stuff but it didn’t bother me, it would be nice to listen to music with you sometime :)
	musicNerd: Oh… yeah, that’d be cool. I could play you some stuff you’ve never heard before. Promise I won’t talk too much about obscure genres
musicNerd: I should probably get a new speaker, it has been weird since the night before you came, the night of the you know. .. The bug guy seems to be bothered by my speaker, I wonder if he took it and did something.
