rowan: Ah user! How faired thine nights rest?
rowan: Pray, what sword dost thou hold most dear?
- Oh you know, uh a … long? sword..
	rowan: Ah! The longsword… [blabs about swords and stuff]
- I don’t have one, maybe you can show me which of your swords is best!
	rowan: I can reveal unto thee mine collection! Then thou mayst choose.
rowan: One of mine swords is misplaced. I do ponder whereabout it be. They provide most trusty protection, yet who can say what foes lurk close at hand.
