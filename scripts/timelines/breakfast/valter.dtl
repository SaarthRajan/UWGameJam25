valter: {user}. This is a good time to talk, over breakfast. 
- Talk about what?
	valter: Do you not know what happened before you came? There was a murder. You can’t be clueless about it.
- Yes! Breakfast and chit chat! What’s your major?
	valter: I’m in chem, and I meant to talk to you about what you know. Who you think did it. Who you think did it. (mumbles: and maybe how you did it)
valter: Purple Knight has swords you know, easily a murder weapon. But it could be anyone. Anyone could take their swords. The one sword has been missing since you were here...
